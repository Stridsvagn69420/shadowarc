Daemon for properly storing ShadowPlay files when written to my Linux NAS

## Purpose
I have a Samba share running on my Raspberry Pi and ShadowPlay's saving location is pointed to it, so that clips automatically get stored on my NAS.  
There are two problems with it though:
1. It directly saves to HDD storage instead of Flash storage.
2. Screenshots are also saved in a folder that's only dedicated to videos.

They aren't actually that much of a problem, but rather just annoyances, but I know that spending hours automating a two minute task is worth it!
